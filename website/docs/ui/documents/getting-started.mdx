Follow the steps below to quickly get started using the component library.

## Install

Install Resolid NxtUI base package by running either of the following:

```shell
## NPM
npm install @resolid/nxt-ui
## PNPM
pnpm add @resolid/nxt-ui
## Yarn
yarn add @resolid/nxt-ui
```

Install Resolid NxtUI Tailwind CSS preset as a dev dependency by running either of the following:

```shell
## NPM
npm install -D @resolid/nxt-tailwind
## PNPM
pnpm add -D @resolid/nxt-tailwind
## Yarn
yarn add -D @resolid/nxt-tailwind
```

## Adding the Tailwind CSS preset

Make sure that you have [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/solidjs) installed, then inside the `tailwind.config.cjs` file:

1. Add Resolid NxtUI in the `content` array, in order to get the classes applied to the components.
2. Require the preset for Tailwind CSS.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [require('@resolid/nxt-tailwind')()],
  content: ['./node_modules/@resolid/nxt-ui/dist/*.{js,cjs,mjs}', './src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx,mdx}'],
  theme: {},
};
```

## Using the components

Import the components you need and start building your application.

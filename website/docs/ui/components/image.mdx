## Import

```javascript
import { Image } from '@resolid/nxt-ui';
```

## Basic

The attributes of an image are the same as those of the HTML image element, which can be found in the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attributes).

The style of an image can be customized using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which is very flexible.
